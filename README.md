## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

twitter-kpi is an invaluable tool for social media analytics, marketing research, and understanding public sentiment. It allows users to track the performance of a specific Twitter account over time, providing insights into audience engagement and content effectiveness.

## Setup and Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To get the twitter-kpi running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
   Use the command `git clone https://github.com/nardis556/twitter-kpi.git` to clone the repository.

2. **Install the required Python dependencies.**
   Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and install the required Python dependencies found in the `requirements.txt` file by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Set up a MySQL database.**
   Install and set up a MySQL database on your machine. Note down the database credentials (username, password, host, and database name), which will be required later.

4. **Obtain your Twitter API credentials.**
   Create a Twitter Developer account and apply for a Twitter API key. Note down the API key, API key secret, Access token, and Access token secret for later use.

5. **Edit the Cron scripts.**
   In the repository, you will find a `.sh` scripts meant to be executed via Cron. Open these scripts and ensure that the Python executable path points to the Python installation on your machine.

6. **Configure Docker container names.**
   If you're using Docker to manage your MySQL and PHPMyAdmin instances, ensure that the Docker container names in the `.sh` scripts match your Docker container names. 

7. **Add credentials to the `config.py` file.**
   Copy the `.config.py` file to `config.py` file and add your MySQL database credentials, Twitter API credentials, and the bot configs in the corresponding sections.

8. **Add the `.sh` scripts to Cron.**
   Use the command `crontab -e` to open the crontab file for editing. Add entries for each of the `.sh` scripts. A typical entry might look like this:
   
   */5 * * * * /path/to/script.sh
   
   This would run the script every 5 minutes.

9. **Set up automatic script monitoring.**
The Cron jobs will ensure that the script is run regularly. If you want the system to check if the scripts are running and automatically restart them if they're not, you'll need to add additional logic to your scripts. This could be a simple check at the start of each script that checks if the process is already running, and if not, starts it.

By following these steps, you should have a working instance of the twitter-kpi. This tool will provide valuable insights into the performance of your Twitter account, helping you optimize your social media presence.
